# Introduction

Although psychological and behavioral manifestations of schizophrenia are well-studied, neuroscientists have
yet to determine a set of corresponding neurological biomarkers. One
fMRI analysis technique, called dynamic functional network connectivity  (dFNC) [1], uses K-Means clustering
to characterize time-varying connectivity between functional networks to identify schizophrenia biomarkers. Although dFNC has been used to determine biomarkers in the past [14, 12, 13, 5] little attention has been given to choice of
clustering technique. In this project, we study how modifying the clustering technique in the dFNC pipeline
can yield dynamic states from fMRI data that impact the accuracy of classifying schizophrenia.

We experiment with DBSCAN, Hiearcharial Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models clustering methods on subject connectivity matrices produced from fMRI data, and each algorithm's cluster assignments as features for SVMs, MLP, Nearest Neighbor, and other supervised classification algorithms to classify schizophrenia. 

Section II describes the fMRI data used in our experimentation, while Section III summarizes the aforementioned clustering and classification algorithms used in the pipeline. Section IV compares the accuracy of these classifiers, along with presenting a series of charts that analyze the cluster assignments produced on the fMRI data.

# dFNCluster

dFNCluster implements Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) with several clustering algorithms, and
actively compares the performance of classification under different clustering algorithms and hyper-parameters.

## Prerequisites

First, install git submodules

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This project has been tested in Python 3.6+

It is recommended you use a conda virtual environment.

```
conda create -y --name dfncluster
```

and install requirements via pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

## Sklearn Datasets

To generate a data set from SKlearn for testing purposes, you can generate one of the datasets in `data/SklearnDatasets`.

For example, the moons data set can be generated as follows:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/SklearnDatasets/Moons/Moons.py
```

which will save `moons.npy` in the `data/SklearnDatasets/Moons` directory.

The following datasets have been included as examples:

* Moons
* Classification (sklearn.datasets.make_classification)
* Blobs (sklearn.datasets.make_blobs)
* MNIST (sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml(name='mnist_...)
* Iris (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)

## Fbirn Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses from real data, run the following

first, untar the data
```
cd data/MatDatasets/FbirnTC
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/MatDatasets/FbirnTC/FbirnTC.py
```

And run the main function, which performs dFNC analysis, and classification
using cluster assignments, and raw states for comparison
```
PYTHONPATH=. python main.py
```


## SIMTB Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses, run the following

first, untar the simulated data
```
cd data/MatDatasets/OmegaSim
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the simulations data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/MatDatasets/OmegaSim/OmegaSim.py
```

### Running on Subsets

To run on a subset of the simulated data set, you can either edit data.csv in the data directory, and rebuild,
or copy that directory under a new name, edit, rebuild and point main.py to the new data set.

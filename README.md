# dFNCluster

dFNCluster implements Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) with several clustering algorithms, and
actively compares the performance of classification under different clustering algorithms and hyper-parameters.

## Prerequisites

First, install git submodules

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This project has been tested in Python 3.6+

It is recommended you use a conda virtual environment.

```
conda env create -y --name dfncluster
```

and install requirements via pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

## Sklearn Datasets

To generate a data set from SKlearn for testing purposes, you can generate one of the datasets in `data/SklearnDatasets`.

For example, the moons data set can be generated as follows:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/SklearnDatasets/Moons/Moons.py
```

which will save `moons.npy` in the `data/SklearnDatasets/Moons` directory.

The following datasets have been included as examples:

* Moons
* Classification (sklearn.datasets.make_classification)
* Blobs (sklearn.datasets.make_blobs)
* MNIST (sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml(name='mnist_...)
* Iris (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)

## Fbirn Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses from real data, run the following

first, untar the data
```
cd data/FNCDatasets/FbirnFNC
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/FNCDatasets/FbirnFNC/FbirnFNC.py
```

And run the main function, which performs dFNC analysis, and classification
using cluster assignments, and raw states for comparison
```
PYTHONPATH=. python main.py
```


## SIMTB Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses, run the following

first, untar the simulated data
```
cd data/FNCDatasets/OmegaSim
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the simulations data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/FNCDatasets/OmegaSim/OmegaSim.py
```

### Running on Subsets

To run on a subset of the simulated data set, you can either edit data.csv in the data directory, and rebuild,
or copy that directory under a new name, edit, rebuild and point main.py to the new data set.

## Other Examples

TODO (Brad): Make example run files, and writeups for other data sets, such as OpenNeuro

# Introduction

Schizophrenia is a chronic and serious mental disorder which affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Although there have been many studies about psychological and behavioral manifestations of schizophrenia, neuroscientists have yet to determine a set of corresponding neurological biomarkers for this disorder. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can help determine non-invasive biomarkers for schizophrenia in brain function[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2) and one such fMRI analysis technique called, dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC)[[3]](#ref3)[[4]](#ref4)[[10]](#ref10), uses K-Means clustering to characterize time-varying connectivity between functional networks. Researchers have worked on finding correlation between schizophrenia and dFNC[[1]](#ref1)[[2]](#ref2)[[5]](#ref5)[[6]](#ref6), but little work has been done with the choice of clustering algorithm[[7]](#ref7)[[9]](#ref9). Therefore, in this project, we have studied how modifying the clustering technique in the dFNC pipeline can yield dynamic states from fMRI data that impact the accuracy of classifying schizophrenia[[8]](#ref8).

We experimented with DBSCAN, Hiearcharial Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models clustering methods on subject connectivity matrices produced from fMRI data, and each algorithm's cluster assignments as features for SVMs, MLP, Nearest Neighbor, and other supervised classification algorithms to classify schizophrenia.

Section II describes the fMRI data used in our experimentation, while Section III summarizes the aforementioned clustering and classification algorithms used in the pipeline. Section IV compares the accuracy of these classifiers, along with presenting a series of charts that analyze the cluster assignments produced on the fMRI data.

# Section II: Data

All datasets used in this project are derivatives of fMRI data (functional magnetic resonance imaging), which is data measuring brain activity to track a patient's thought processs over a predefined time period.

### Gaussian Simulated Dataset 

We derive our own synthetic dataset in order to test out our clusterers and classifiers on a simulated dataset for sanity checking their implementation. 

The data set was generated by a seed set of $M=50$ source gaussian signals, which were organized into $k=5$ "connectivity states". Each of the 5 connectivity states is a block-diagonal matrix with a block of size $M/k$ which is located on the
$i*M/k+M/k$th entry with a size of $i*M/k$. For each state, the set the pairs of relevant source signals to come from the same distribution, so that their correlation without additional additive noise is 1. 

For each subject, we generate a source signal of sime $M \times T-W$ where $T$ is the length of the time-course, and $W$ is the size of the sliding window. Over each window, we randomly select which state the window belongs to, drawing from a prior distribution of state probabilities for a subject's class, $P_{c,k}$. Additionally,  for each class we simulate a transition probability $Q_{c, k}$ for each state, with higher probabilities meaning a higher chance of transitioning out of that state into some other state. Finally, we restrict the simulation such that transitions can only occur after a state has existed for a $W$-many timepoints. This restrictions allows us to assert with some certainty that each of the seed states will occur within some window for that subject.

For each class, we simulate baseline signal noise from a normal distribution, which the relevant source signal being added to that baseline.

Formally a single subjects signal within a window of size W is given as:

$$X_i = \mathcal{N}(\theta_{c}) +  \mathcal{N}(\theta_{k})$$

where $\theta_{c}$ and $\theta_{k}$ are the parameters for the baseline class signal for class $c$ and the source signal for state $k$ respectively. Because all source signals for state $k$ will have the same distribution, their correlation will be high, providing the same block-matrix correlation for the dFNC analysis.

The probability for entering from state $k$ into a new state $k'$ at a timepoint $T$, given that the last transition occured $W$ time-points ago, is given as the joint probability of the prior distribution for the class ever entering into state $k'$, as well as the probability of transitioning out of state $k$.
i.e.
$$
Z_{c, k, k'}(P_{c,k'}, Q_{c,k})
$$

The addition of noise, and the fact that windows are created with a size $W$ at each timepoint means that there is a high chance for bleed-over between the actual states detected for an individual subject.

For example the following connectivity matrices were computed from randomly selected subjects from each class, for each state:

| Class |                                  State 0                                  |                                  State 1                                  |                                  State 2                                  |                                  State 3                                  |                                  State 4                                  |
| :---: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------: |

For our simulation we generate $C=2$ classes, $K=5$ states, for $N=300$ subjects with $M=50$ source signals. The parameters $Q$ were set at 0.5 for each class and each state, so that transitioning out of states was equally likely for all classes and states. Baseline noise was set at $\sigma_c= 1\times 10^{-2}$ for each class, and the $sigma_k$ for all source signals was set at $sigma_k = 1\times 10^{-1}$.

The parameters for $P$ for each class were selected as:

| Class Parameter | State 0 | State 1 | State 2 | State 3 | State 4 |
| --------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| $P_(c=0,k)$     | 0.4     | 0.1     | 0.1     | 0.3     | 0.1     |
| $P_(c=1,k)%     | 0.1     | 0.1     | 0.3     | 0.1     | 0.4     |


### FBIRN Dataset 

We use derivatives from the Phase 3 Dataset of FBIRN (Functional Biomedical Infromatics Research Network Data Repository), which specifically focuses on brain activity maps from patients with schizophrenia. This dataset includes 186 healthy controls and 176 indivduals from schizophrenia from around the United States. Subject participants in this dataset are between the ages of 18-62. 

### UCLA Dataset

We also use derivatives from the UCLA Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics archives, which includes neuroimages for roughly 272 participants. The subject population consists of roughly 272 healthy controls, as well as participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (50 subjects). Subject participants in this dataset range from 21 to 50 years 

# Section III: Methods

## Overview

<img width="100%" src="results/dfnc_pipeline(1).png?raw=True" />

## Preprocessing

As is standard in Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity, Group Independent Component Analysis of subject images is used to compute a set of $M$ statistically independent spatial maps from the data, along with a set of $M$ time-courses, which are used for the dFNC analysis. For the Fbirn data, we used pre-computed ICA timecourses provided by Damaraju et al. 2014. These timecourses were computed using Infomax ICA [] with 100 components, which were then manually selected based on biological relevance for a total of 47 remaining components. For the UCLA data, because no ICA derivatives were readily available, we used Group Information Guided ICA [] which is included as part of the GIFT NeuroImaging Analysis Toolbox []. As a template for GIG-ICA, we used the NeuroMark template [], which has been shown to provide reliable estimations of components in many different settings. This provides us with 53 independent components for Uhe UCLA data.

### Sliding Window Analysis

For all data-sets we chose a sliding window of size $W=22$, following the precedent in Damaraju et al. 2014 []. Time-Series data $X$ with size $M \times T$, where $M$ is the number of independent components, and $T$ is the number of timepoints are used. 
Time series were normalized and convolved with a gaussian window with a kernel of size 0.015, again following the precedent in Damaraju et al. 2014. 
For each window on each time-series a number of exemplar data-points were selected by taking the local maximum of the variance from the smoothed time-series. 

We computed correlation coefficients across the components, within each time series window to form the FNC matrix with entries $i$ and $j$ given as 

$$
  FNC_{i,j} = \frac{1}{W}  \frac{\sum_{w=1}^{W} X_i X_j - (\sum_{w=1}^{W}X_i)(\sum_{w=1}^{W}X_j)  }{W \sqrt{(\sum X_i^2 - (\sum X_i)^2)(\sum X_j^2 - (\sum X_j)^2)}}
$$

Through this process, we generat a total of $N\times(T-W)$ window instances, which are used as the input for clustering.

## Clustering Details

We implemented 5 different clustering algorithms as part of the dFNC pipeline: K-Means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models, and 
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

### Elbow Criterion

For K-Means, GMM, bGMM, and Agglomerative clustering, we measured the elbow criterion on a range of 2-9 components. We measured both the correlation-distance dispersion, as is recommended in Damaraju et al. 2014 [], as well as the silhouette measure. The results from this analysis are included below. In general, we found either unclear or multiple elbows in the range $K=3,4,5,6$ for each data set, with the location of the elbow varying depending on the clustering algorithm used and the data set. Thus, we decided to compromise, and use the choice of $K=5$ from Damaraju et al., which is an established result for the Fbirn data set, and which is a common number of clusters chosen elswhere in the literature.

## Classification Details

### Feature Generation

As features for generation, we follow the precedent in [], and compute means of clusters for each class, and use these centers to form a regression matrix of size $2k \times (T-W)$. For each subject, we then regress out these cluster centers from each FNC window, and collect the beta coefficients. The mean of the $\beta$-coefficients over all timepoints are then used as features for the final classification.

### Evaluation Metric

For our evaluation metric, we used the Area-Under the "Receiving Operating Characteric" (ROC) curve, or AUC.

### Grid Search

We performed a Grid-Search over all available parameters for each of the classifiers available in Polyssifier. For each set of training data used for cross-validation, we trained the grid-search separately, and took the parameters with the highest AUC. 

# Section IV: Results & Discussion

## Initial UCLA Significant Comparisons

In order to evaluate the predictive capacities of the features produced by each clustering algorithm, a
two-tailed t-test was performed comparing the healthy control and the schizophrenic patients.

The first t-test comparision was performed using the cluster assignments for each patient across
the time domain where each time slot represented a feature of the training data. For each time slot (feature),
the average cluster assignment for all the healthy control patients was compared to the average cluster assignment
for all the schizophrenic patients. The corresponding p-values were then tested at a significance level of 0.10.

The results displayed below highlight the points in time when there was less that a 10% chance that the
observed difference in a healthy control's cluster assignment and a schizophrenic's cluster assignment was due to normal
random variation. In theory, the more points of significance across time the more likely a trained model would accurately
diagnose a subject. The results indicated that both K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models failed to produce statistically
different cluster assignments across time. The Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model produced some significant differences while
the Hierarchical clustering was significant at every time point.

These results initially suggested that Hierarchical clustering would outperform all the other clustering algorithms,
but the subsequent testing disporved this hypothesis.

![](images/assignment_t_test_visualization.png?raw=true)

Given the lack of improvement in accuracy across all clustering algorithms, it was believed that training supervised
models using using time points as features would require much more data for successful classification.
Using time slots as features meant that there were 130 features in the data. Since there were only 267 patients
in the UCLA data set, it was surmised that the dimensionality of the data was too high. To reduce the dimensionality
of the datasets, the beta coefficients were calculated reducing the number of training features form 130 to 10.

![](images/beta_t_test_visualization.png?raw=true)

Each clustering algorithm produced statistically different beta coefficients between the health control and
schizophrenic patients. With the reduced dimenstionality of the data, we successfully improved the accuracy of
out diagnoses across all supervised learning algorithms for each clustering algorithm. These results are discussed
later in the report.

## Reporting Results

For all results, the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric was used since we were trying to classify two possible outcomes.
Patients were with either healthy or had schizophrenia. AUC scores near 0.50 meant that the models randomly diagnosed
patients as healthy or schizophrenic. This represented the worst possible outcome. Any model with and AUC scores between
0.40 and 0.60 was deemed a failed model. AUC scores near 1.0 meant that diagnoses were accurate with few false positives
(high specificiy) and few false negatives (high recall). There were no observed models that completely reversed the
diagnoses with AUC scores near 0.0.

## Gaussian Simulated Dataset

We initially trained the supervised learning algorithms using simulated Gaussian datasets since we did not
have access to the real patient data until later in the semester. We first trained the supervised learning models
without any clustering in order to establish a baseline AUC scores for our clustering algorithms to impove upon.
These baseline results are displayed below.

![](images/sim_pre_clustering_AUC.png?raw=true)

The key result from this experiment was that without any clustering, no supervised learning algorithm could consistently
achieve and AUC score above 0.60. Some learners such as the Multilayer Perceptron, Passive Aggressive Classifier,
and Bernoulli Naive Bayes surprisingly scored below 0.40 suggesting that they consistently misdiagnose patients.
This result was attributed to being due to random error, and was disregarded.

After establishing the baseline AUC scores, we performed clustering and beta feature generation for the simulated
Gaussian datasets. Using these clustered and reduced datasets, we trained across the same classifiers to for each
clustering algorithm (K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical)
to generate the results below.

The clustering combined with the beta feature generation dramatically improved the AUC scores on the simulated
Gaussian datasets. All clustering algorithms produced AUC scores above 0.90 with standard deviations below 0.05 across
all supervised models. The hierarchical clustering even produced perfect predictions. These results confirmed our
suspicions that in order to accurately diagnose patients, we needed to perform clustering and reduce the number
of features we trained our models on. These initial results using simulated data helped us tremendously when deploying
our models on real patient data.

## FBIRN Dataset

The FBIRN dataset was trained in the exact same manner as the as the simulated Guassian dataset. First, the supervised 
models were trained without clustering or beta feature generation. As expected, the classifiers failed to consistently
achieve AUC scores outside of the 0.40-0.60 range suggesting that all the models produced random diagnoses.
The baseline results are displayed below.

![](images/fbirn_pre_clustering_AUC.png?raw=true)

Next we trained the models on the FBIRN data after clustering and using only cluster assignments. No beta features
were generated to reduce the dimensionality of the training dataset. The results are displayed below.

<img width="86%" src="results/fbirn_assignments_accuracy.png?raw=true" /> <img width="12%" src="results/accuracy_legend.png?raw=true" />


The results indicated that is was possible for some of the clustering algorithms to lift the AUC scores to an average
of 0.70 for most supervised models with the exclusion the Voting learner. The one exception was DBSCAN which failed to
move the AUC from 0.50. Regardless, none of these models achieved a high enough score to be used a clinical environment.
It was surmised the number of features in the datasets had to be reduced from cluster assignments over time to beta
features in order for the supervised learning models to accurately diagnose patients.

After performing beta features generation with clustering, the final results for the FBIRN dataset were obtained and
are displayed below.

As expected, the reduced number of training features increased the accuracy of all the learners with Support Vector Machines
acheiveing the highest accuracy acrocc all clustering algorithms. Only DBCAN failed to get above an average AUC score of 0.90
for support vector machines and Hierarchical clusterting obtained this highest score of 0.957.

## UCLA Dataset

The UCAL Dataset was similarly trained. Firstly, it was trained using unclustered data to establish a baseline to compare
against. The results are displayed below and as expected the supervised mdoels failed to obtain suitable AUC scores.


![](images/ucla_pre_clustering_AUC.png?raw=true)

The below plot shows "Accuracy" of various classifiers such as KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model(BGMM),
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Hierarchical clustering methods on
Simulated Gaussian Data using beta features. Accuracy has improved a lot in comparison to the previous case above without clusterer and without
using beta feature say for example from 0.7 to 0.9 for KMeans with "Multi Layer Perceptron" and likewise for other clusterer.
Almost all the classifiers in all the clusterer shows improvement over KMeans clustering.

# Section V: Conclusion


# dFNCluster

dFNCluster implements Dynamic Functional Network Connectivity (dFNC) with several clustering algorithms, and
actively compares the performance of classification under different clustering algorithms and hyper-parameters.

## Prerequisites

First, install git submodules

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This project has been tested in Python 3.6+

It is recommended you use a conda virtual environment.

## Examples

## Sklearn Datasets

To generate a data set from SKlearn for testing purposes, you can generate one of the datasets in `data/SklearnDatasets`.

For example, the moons data set can be generated as follows:

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/SklearnDatasets/Moons/Moons.py
```

which will save `moons.npy` in the `data/SklearnDatasets/Moons` directory.

The following datasets have been included as examples:

* Moons
* Classification (sklearn.datasets.make_classification)
* Blobs (sklearn.datasets.make_blobs)
* MNIST (sklearn.datasets.fetch_openml(name='mnist_...)
* Iris (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)

## Fbirn Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses from real data, run the following

first, untar the data
```
cd data/MatDatasets/FbirnTC
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/MatDatasets/FbirnTC/FbirnTC.py
```

And run the main function, which performs dFNC analysis, and classification
using cluster assignments, and raw states for comparison
```
PYTHONPATH=. python main.py
```


## SIMTB Data

To run with the pre-computed ICA Timecourses, run the following

first, untar the simulated data
```
cd data/MatDatasets/OmegaSim
tar -xzf subjects.tar.gz
```

back in the dfncluster directory, build the simulations data set, which serializes
the data set object as a pickled npy file

```
PYTHONPATH=. python data/MatDatasets/OmegaSim/OmegaSim.py
```

### Running on Subsets

To run on a subset of the simulated data set, you can either edit data.csv in the data directory, and rebuild,
or copy that directory under a new name, edit, rebuild and point main.py to the new data set.
